/*You are given an integer N. Your task is to print the pascalâ€™s triangle till the row N.

A Pascal's triangle is a triangular array constructed by summing adjacent elements in preceding rows. 
Pascal's triangle contains the values of the binomial coefficient. For example in the figure below. 

For example, given integer N= 4 then you have to print.

---1  
--1-1 
-1-2-1 
1-3-3-1

Here for the third row, you will see that the second element is the summation of the above two-row elements 
i.e. 2=1+1, and similarly for row three 3 = 1+2 and 3 = 1+2.
Refer notes for proper logic
